### Description

The image provided below is a web app that takes a sequence of numbers that are separated by comma as a input variable and predict the the next value. For example if the input value is a sequence of 0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5 then the predicted output value is 0.32117355. The web app is build using the LSTM model (i.e., a neural network model) to help demorate the predictions of a numerical output.
